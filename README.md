## Code-base structure

The project is coded using a simple and intuitive structure presented bellow:

```bash

<br />

> The bootstrap flow

- Django bootstrapper `manage.py` uses `core/settings.py` as the main configuration file
- `core/settings.py` loads the app magic from `.env` file
- Redirect the guest users to Login page
- Unlock the pages served by *app* node for authenticated users

<br />

> Paths

In this code, the following paths are used:
- root_path: media/unzipped/case_study_XXXXXXXXX/executions/exec_XX/
- scenario_path: media/unzipped/case_study_XXXXXXXXX/executions/exec_XX/scenario1/
- log_path: media/unzipped/case_study_XXXXXXXXX/executions/exec_XX/scenario1/log.csv
- scenario_results_path:  media/unzipped/case_study_XXXXXXXXX/executions/exec_XX/scenario1_results/

## Recompile CSS

To recompile SCSS files, follow this setup:

<br />

**Step #1** - Install tools

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 12.x or higher
To install node in this environment
    - `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash` (install NVM (Node Version Manager))
Close and reopen the terminal
    - `nvm --version` (to check nvm is installed ok)
    - `nvm install 12` (Version 12 is full compatible)
    - `node -v` (to check node is installed ok)
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - globally 
    - `npm install -g gulp-cli`
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (optional) 

<br />

**Step #2** - Change the working directory to `assets` folder

```bash
$ cd apps/static/assets
```

<br />

**Step #3** - Install modules (this will create a classic `node_modules` directory)

```bash
$ npm install
// OR
$ yarn
```

<br />

**Step #4** - Edit & Recompile SCSS files 

```bash
$ gulp scss
```

The generated file is saved in `static/assets/css` directory.

<br /> 

## Deployment

The app is provided with a basic configuration to be executed in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/), and [Waitress](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/).

### [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) execution
---

The application can be easily executed in a docker container. The steps:

> Get the code

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/RPA-US/rim.git
$ cd rim
```

> Create a .env file

Copy the .env.sample in the docker folder and replace the values for those you desire.

> Build the container for the app in Docker

There are four images for this application, two for development  and production for systems with nvidia GPUs and two for development and production for those without an nvidia GPU.

```bash
$ sudo docker-compose -f ./docker/<docker-compose-file> up
```

> Start the application

Follow the instructions to run the applications from the "Create tables" section onwards.

If you want to use celery run the following commands:

```bash
$ redis-server
$ python -m celery -A core worker --concurrency=1
```

Visit `http://localhost:85` in your browser. The app should be up & running.

<br />
